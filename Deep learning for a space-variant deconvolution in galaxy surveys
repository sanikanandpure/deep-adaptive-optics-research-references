## summary
The study uses simulations of realistic galaxy images derived from HST observations, with realistically sampled sparse-variant PSFs and noise, processed with the GalSim simulation code.

## notes
### abstract readthrough:
- deconvolution of images require consideration to space-variant point spread function
- deep learning 
- U-net neural networks where a U-shape is created using down and up-sampling (Simply put, it analyzes the image by small pieces -
zooming into tiny details / pixels (down sampling) and then pieces the details together (upsampling).
- 1st approach is a post-processing of a mere Tikhonov deconvolution with closed-form solution
- 2nd approach is an iterative deconvolution framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
- techniques outperform standard techniques
-- Tikhonov approach yields highly accurate resutls except for ellipticity errors at high signal-to-noise ratio, where the ADMM approach performs slightly better
- Tikhonov is more efficient.

### key points
- PSF (point spread function) ( The PSF field is usually estimated beforehand through parametric models and simulations as in Krist _et al._ (2011) or is directly estimated from
the (noisy) observations of stars in the field of view )
- 
- More than 1000 images were processed


### conclusion
- 2 new space-variant deconvolution strategies for galaxy images based on deep neural networks 
- the Tikhonet approach is a post-processing approach of a simple Tikhonov deconvolution with a DNN, 
- the ADMMnet approach is based on regularization by a DNN denoiser inside an iterative ADMM PnP algorithm for deconvolution.
