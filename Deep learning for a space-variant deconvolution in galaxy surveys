## notes

### 2️⃣ second pass: detailed read
#### traditional methods
- An adaptive optics system includes:
	- deformable mirror (DM)
	- WFS (wavefront sensing)
	- real-time controller (RTC)
	- post-processing program
- WFS is a technique that provides a signal with which the shape of a wavefront can be estimated with sufficient accuracy --> does this in real-time

### conclusion
- ANN can be used to build the relationship between the measurement (image) and the wavefront for wavefront reconstruction
- features extracted from data may perform better than the manually selected linear ones
- some iterative methods for phase retrieval may be replaced by deep learning for faster speed
- ANNs can also be used to do the nonlinear wavefront prediction for better accuracy and improved time-delay
- Data is super important for this purpose - some data can be generated by the computer for training but its adaptability to real systems needs to be demonstrated
- unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning are future treasure troves for more ideas and progress in the field
