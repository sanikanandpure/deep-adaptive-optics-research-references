## summary 

## notes
* SCARLET framework is one of the big current deblenders, probably a good idea to read its associated paper
* paper builds models that help determine if galaxy blending is even occurring
* dataset: simulated galaxy images created by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration + simulated properties from cosmoDC2 & DESC DC2 -> there was a lot more in this section about the simulation of data which i didn't really understand
* Models examined:
	* Peak Finding (current common method, also gives # of objects)
	* CNN
	* Logistic Regression
	* Gaussian Process Regression 
* conclusion: CNN better unblended accuracy while Gaussian has better blended accuracy

(note: pipeline, custom, & variant were three different ways the data was preprocessed)
## other research referenced (might be a good place to look)
