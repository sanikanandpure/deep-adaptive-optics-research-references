## notes

* why: wide field of view surveys (ex. Legacy Survey of Space and Time) will have difficulty using adaptive optics (ao)
* this causes blending - incorrect measurement and analysis 
* psf (point spread function) - function that maps how a single point of light is distorted
* problems with previous research: assumes galaxy in middle, fixed # of galaxies in image assumed
* the framework has two main components -> a **classifier** and a **deblender** 
	* the classifier finds out how many galaxies there are 
	* deblender gets image of just one galaxy (brightest)
	* remove that galaxy from the blend 
	* process repeats until no more galaxies

deblender arch:
* two convolution layers for feature extraction 
* series of residual dense blocks, each containing a series of convolution layers with an ReLU activation function 
classifier: VGG-16 network 

data: synthetic images generated with BlendingToolKit w/ LSST DM catalog 

Source Extractor - industry standard for this kind of stuff
this model outperforms on flux recovery 

limitations/future work: variable psf in different bands, 

this is missing a lot of the details about the specifics of the model, i just wanted to get the tldr down
